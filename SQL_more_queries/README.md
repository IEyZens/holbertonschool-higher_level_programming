# SQL - More Queries üìö

## üìå Description

This project builds on your knowledge of SQL by introducing advanced operations involving user privileges, constraints, relational integrity, and multi-table queries including subqueries, joins, and unions.

You will work with multiple databases and learn how to design and query them in more sophisticated ways.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without looking it up):

- How to create a new MySQL user
- How to grant privileges to a user on a database or table
- What a PRIMARY KEY and a FOREIGN KEY are
- How to apply NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints
- How to retrieve data from multiple tables in one query
- How to use subqueries and JOINs
- How to use UNION to merge results

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- MySQL version: `8.0.25` or higher
- Each `.sql` file must:
  - Start with a comment describing the task
  - Include a comment before each SQL query
  - Use uppercase for SQL keywords (e.g. `SELECT`, `FROM`)
  - End with a new line
  - Be checked with `wc` for length

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.

## üì¶ Importing Provided Data

To import the dump for TV shows:

```bash
echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
curl -s "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet.project.files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Always comment your queries
- Use consistent formatting
- Use only one `SELECT` statement when specified
- Use `JOIN`, `UNION`, or subqueries as required
